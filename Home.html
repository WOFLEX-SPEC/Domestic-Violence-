                </h1><br>
                <p>
                    Domestic violence is a pattern of abusive behaviour in any relationship<br> that is  used
                    by one parthner to gain or maintain power<br> and control over another intimate parthner;
                </p><br>
                <h3>We have four main types of violence</h3>
                <li>Physical violence</li>
                <li>Verbal violence(including speech)</li>
                <li>Sexual violence</li>
                <li>Socio-economic violence</li>
            </div><br>
            <div>
                <h1>
                    Physical violence

                </h1>
                <img src="Images/Physical_790887175.jpg">
                <p>this is when the individual hits the parthner directly which<br> can lead to bleeding
                    and wounds this can be done by slapping<br> hittingetc.
                </p>
                <h1>Verbal violence</h1>
                <img src="Images/North-Carolina-Verbal-Abuse-Attorneys-300x200.webp" width="50%">
                <p>However, when these attacks become regular and systematic and<br> purposefully target someone’s sensitive spots7, the object of the attacks is right to <br>consider themselves victims of verbal abuse. Verbal violence can include issues<br> that are specific to a person, such as putdowns (in private or in<br> front of others), ridiculing, the use of swear-words that are especially uncomfortable<br> for the other, saying bad things about the other’s loved ones, threatening<br> with other forms of violence, either against the victim or against<br> somebody dear to them. At other times, the verbal abuse may be relevant<br> to the background of the victim, such as their religion, culture,<br> language, (perceived) sexual orientation or traditions. Depending on<br> the most emotionally sensitive areas of the victim, abusers often consciously<br> target these issues in a way that is painful, humiliating and threatening<br> to the victim.</p>
                <h1>Sexual violence</h1>
                <img src="Images/653x366-img-71769-sexual-violence-illustration.jpg">
                <p>Sexual violence means that someone forces or manipulates someone else into unwanted <br>sexual activity without their consent. Reasons someone might not consent include fear, <br>age, illness, disabil- ity, and/or influence of alcohol or other drugs.</p>
                <h1>Socio-econimic violence</h1>
                <img src="Images/29.jpg" width="50%">
                <p>Economic abuse can include exerting control over income, spending, bank accounts, bills<br> and borrowing. It can also include controlling access to and use of things<br> like transport and technology, which allow us to work and stay connected,<br> as well as property and daily essentials like food and clothing.</p>

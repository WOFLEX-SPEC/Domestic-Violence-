                <p>This violation of human rights can take many forms, including physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.<br> Women are more likely than men to be victims of domestic violence. Women who experience <br>intimate partner violence have more health needs and seek health services <br>more frequently than the general population, and their use of these<br> services rises as the frequency and severity of violence <br>increases. ~ Black MC

                    According to World Health Organization, the health<br> consequences of domestic violence on women can be immediate, acute, <br>long-lasting or chronic, and the common ones include;

                   <p> Acute or immediate physical injuries, such as<br> bruises, lacerations, punctures, burns and bites, as well as fractures and<br> broken bones or teeth
                    More serious injuries, which can lead to disabilities
                    Long term health problems and poor health <br>status
                    Death
                    Additionally, women who experience domestic violence are more prone to <br>develop mental illnesses like post-traumatic stress disorder, <br>depression, anxiety, sleeping problems<br>, and occasionally even suicidal thoughts.</p>
                    
                    In order to lessen domestic violence in our society, it is advised that victims of domestic abuse come<br> forward or report the abuse to the appropriate authorities for assistance.
                    
                    <br>Domestic violence is unacceptable. Say no to domestic violence.

                <h1>Effects of Domestic Violence</h1>
                <p>Domestic violence survivors can face ongoing and <br>challenging effects after enduring physical, mental, and emotional <br>abuse. It can take time for a survivor to adjust to living in a safe environment,<br> especially if a perpetrator was severely violent and/or committed the <br>actions over an extended period of time.
                    
                    You have a right to be treated with<br> respect by your partner.

                    <p>While addressing this pain can be overwhelming, the<br> healing process can help survivors develop inner strengths and lessen their fear of <br>safety for themselves and their families. On the journey to recovery, <br>survivors and those who support them should understand that healing takes<br> time. The effects of this trauma can vary widely person to person due to individuals’ <br>responses to stress, age, and the frequency and severity of abuse.</p>

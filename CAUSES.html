                    <h2>The factors that cause or contribute to domestic violence are<br> complex. It’s important to remember that the only behavior<br> you’re responsible for is your own. Likewise, a person who<br> commits an act of violence or ongoing pattern of<br> abuse is solely responsible for their decisions.</h2>
                    
                    Why do some people become domestic abusers? The answer is complicated.<br>
                    
                   <p> If you’ve experienced domestic abuse, you might wonder why <br>your abuser acted the way they did. You may hope that learning about<br> the risk factors for abuse can help you make sense of your<br> abuser’s behavior.</p>
                    
                   <p> Domestic violence can take many forms, including physical, sexual, emotional, financial,<br> technological, and psychological abuse.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perpetrators may target their partners (called intimate partner violence), children, siblings,<br> parents, or anyone else in their household. Approximately 10 millionTrusted <br>Source people in the United States experience domestic violence every year.</p>
                    
                   <p> While certain factors can increase the likelihood that someone will become abusive, this doesn’t<br> mean that they shouldn’t be held accountable for their behavior.</p>
                    
                    <p>Their actions are their responsibility — and none of the blame lies with the person who is being<br> abused or violated.</p>

                    <h2>Domestic violence is a learned behavior.</h2>

                    <p>The researchTrusted Source on domestic violence suggests it’s a learned behavior.
                    
                    <p>In other words, people learn to be violent from the household, community, and society that surrounds them.<br> When people witness violence, they may model the same behavior.</p>
                    
                   <p>With that said, it’s possible to unlearn violent behavior and break the cycle of abuse. While people<br> may learn to be abusive from their upbringing and surroundings, the onus is still<br> on them to treat people with respect.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Outside factors can escalate violence, but they don’t cause it.</h2>

                   <p> Although certain factors can contribute to the likelihood that someone will become abusive, these factors <br>aren’t excuses for abuse. Abusive behavior is a choice — the abuser’s choice.</p>
                    
                    <p>ResearchTrusted Source has noted that abusers are often driven by a need to control others.</p>
                    
                    <p>According to studiesTrusted Source, this may be escalated by certain personality characteristics and beliefs,<br> such as:
                    
                   <li> anger management issues</li>
                    <li>believing they have the right to control their partner
                    feelings of inferiority</li>
                    <li>jealousy</li>
                    <li>low self-esteem</li>
                    <p>While characteristics like low self-esteem may aggravate an abuser’s need for control, not all people with low <br>self-esteem become abusive. It also doesn’t mean that they’re off the hook<br> for their own actions.
                    
                    <p>Many abusers may blame external factors for their behavior. They may claim that their victim caused them to become <br>abusive. Some may blame their mental health, substance use, or childhood <br>experiences for their behavior.</p>
                    
                    <p>But mental health conditions don’t cause violent or abusive behavior.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the American Psychological Association (APA) notes, very few people with serious mental health conditions ultimately<br> perpetrate violence — and when they do, it can be because the same factors<br> that lead to mental illness (such as child abuse) also increase their propensity toward <br>violence.
                    
                    <p>Mental illness, while challenging, is not an excuse for harming others.</p>
                    
                    <p>Likewise, substance use disorder — which is also a mental health condition — doesn’t cause violence. But people with<br> co-occurring substance use may have an increased risk of becoming violent,<br> says the APA.
                    
                    <p>While some people may become more violent when they’re intoxicated, their behavior is still a choice.</p>
            
                <p> </p>
                <h1>Previous history of being abused or witnessing abuse</h1>
                    <P>According to the available researchTrusted Source, people are more likely to become abusive if they’ve <br>witnessed or experienced being abused themselves.</P>
                    
                   <p> Many perpetrators of domestic violence were abused as children, or they grew up in<br> households where abuse occurred. They may grow up believing that violence is a reasonable<br> way to address conflict.
                    
                    This can cause what’s called an intergenerational cycle of abuse: some abused people become <br>abusers.
                    
                    But, many people who are abused as children don’t become abusive. Although being abused<br> as a child may contribute to an abuser’s worldview, it’s important to emphasize that childhood<br> abuse is not an excuse for domestic violence.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Systemic or structural inequities</h2>
                    Some research suggests that systemic inequality may contribute to domestic violence.<br>
                    
                    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source has identified that inequality — <br>specifically gender inequality and income inequality — can contribute to intimate partner <br>violence.
                    
                    The CDC also notes that people are more likely to become abusive if they:<br>
                    
                   <li> have a low income level</li>
                   <li> have a low education level</li>
                    <li>experience economic stress (such as being unemployed)</li>
                Domestic abuse is more widespread in communities with:
                    
                   <li> high rates of poverty</li>
                   <li>low levels of educational opportunities</li>
                   <li>high unemployment rates</li>
                   <li>high rates of violence and crime</li>
                   <li>low levels of community involvement</li>
                    <li>easy access to drugs and alcohol</li>
                    weak community efforts against abuse (for example, when neighbors are unwilling to intervene when they<br> witness violence)
                    With this said, it’s important to note that abusive people can<br> come from all socio-economic brackets, neighborhoods, and cultures.
                    
                    You’ll notice that the language used to share stats and other data points is pretty binary, fluctuating<br> between the use of “male” and “female” or “men” and “women.”
                    
                    Although we typically avoid language like this, specificity is key when reporting on research participants <br>and clinical findings.
                    
                    Unfortunately, the studies and surveys referenced in this article didn’t report data on, or include, participants<br> who were transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, agender, or <br>genderless.
                    
                    
                   <h2> Social or cultural beliefs that reinforce “traditional” values</h2>
                    A well-studied risk factor for domestic violence and intimate partner violence is a belief in<br> “traditional” gender roles.
                    
                    Research shows that sexism is a contributing factor for domestic violence (and, specifically,<br> violence against women).
                    
                    Many cultures and societies believe that women should be submissive to men and that men<br> have the right to control women.
                    
                    Studies — such as this 2019 study and this 2020 study — have noted that a belief in male dominance may contribute to the belief of abusive men, especially in intimate partner violence.
                    
                    But why is there a link between sexism and domestic abuse?
                    
                    A 2018 studyTrusted Source looked at how the link between violence and sexism is studied. It noted research that found links between domestic violence and:
                    
                    the acceptance of violence against women
                    the belief that men should be dominant in relationships
                    male sexual entitlement
                    Gender-based economic inequality may also play a role.
                    
                    A 2020 study concluded that there seems to be a link between traditional gender norms based on the male breadwinner model and intimate partner violence. This could be because women who are economically dependent on their partners may find it difficult to act against or leave abusive partners.

                <p>The mental health effects of domestic violence are likely to be severe and long-lasting [4]. Exposure to violence<br> and abuse increase one’s risk of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety,<br> substance use, and suicidal behaviours [4, 8]. The most commonly employed element of domestic<br> violence–coercive control—is a pattern of domination enacted through tactics designed for intimidation <br>and entrapment, and has particularly damaging effects for mental health [2, 6]. Coercive control strategies <br>include social and physical isolation, shaming and belittlement, micromanagement of daily activities, and<br> constant surveillance. These strategies aim to terrorise, hurt and overwhelm victims, and predict intimate partner homicide<br> [9]. Control strategies may differ by culture and setting, and during the COVID-19 pandemic perpetrators<br> are capitalising on the isolating conditions of lockdowns and home quarantine to enforce separations from<br> social support networks, increase control of victims’ actions and finances, and exacerbate fear<br> within the household [1, 3, 10]. Practitioners are also seeing the use of digital coercive control, whereby <br>perpetrators utilise technology to monitor and track their victims, creating a sense of omnipresence, isolation, and ostracism [9].<br> Coercive control has significant implications for survivors’ mental health, through prolonged, repeated trauma<br> that is both inescapable and unpredictable in nature.</p>
